/*

N number of books are given. 
The ith book has Pi number of pages. 
You have to allocate books to M number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted to a student is minimum. A book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each student has to be allocated at least one book. Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.

NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible

Input:
 List of Books M number of students 

Your function should return an integer corresponding to the minimum number.

Example:

P : [12, 34, 67, 90]
M : 2

Output : 113

There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed in following fashion : 
  1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
  2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages 
  3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages

Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.
